   the following:

   1. If the services are running on the base machine,
      set ADS_ON_CONTAINER to False.

   2. If the services are running on a container,
      set ADS_ON_CONTAINER to True.

   3. Set BASE_IP_ADDRESS = "root@<IP>" where IP is the ip address of
      base machine on which containers are created.

   4. Set ADS_SERVER_VM_ID to CTID of container running ADS.
      ADS_SERVER_VM_ID = "<CTID>" 

   5. SUBNET field to match with the subnet of your base machine
      If the ip address of your base machine is 10.2.58.XXX, 
      SUBNET = ["10.2.58.12/28"]

*** Settings Specific CentOSBrdigeVZAdapter
Following are the specific settings for the bridge adapter. Edit the file 
=ovpl/src/adapters/settings.py= to set the following:
   1. Update the SUBNET_BRIDGE name with name of the bridge which is
